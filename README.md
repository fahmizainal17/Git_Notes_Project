# Comprehensive Git and Development Environment Syllabus

This syllabus covers fundamental Git commands and expands on additional concepts to provide a thorough understanding of Git for version control management. It also includes setup instructions for VS Code, GitHub, and common command line operations.

### Git Basics

### 1. Clone a Repository:
Clone the repository to get a local copy of the code on your machine.
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```git
Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

### 2. Update the Local Repository:
Update your local copy to ensure it's synchronized with the main branch.
```
git pull origin main
```
Replace `main` with the name of your primary branch if different.

### 3. Create a New Branch:
Create a new branch for feature development or bug fixing.
```
git branch feature-branch
```

### 4. Switch to the New Branch:
Switch your working directory to the new branch.
```
git checkout feature-branch
```
Or create and switch in one step:
```
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

### 5. Add and Commit Changes:
After making changes, add them to the staging area and commit.
```
# Add changes to the staging area
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
```

### 6. Create a `.gitignore` File:
Specify untracked files and directories.
```plaintext
# Example .gitignore content
.idea/
*.pyc
```

### 7. Save and Commit `.gitignore`:
```
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore file"
```

### 8. Push Changes to the Main Branch:
```
git push origin main
```

### 9. Open a Pull Request:
Open a pull request for code review and merging your changes.

### 10. Switch Back to the Main Branch:
```
git checkout main
```

### 11. Update the Local Main Branch:
```
git pull origin main
```

## Additional Git Commands and Concepts:
- **Checking Status**: Use `git status` to see the status of your changes.
- **Staging Area**: Understand the importance of the staging area for preparing commits.
- **Commit Message Standards**: Adopt a consistent format for commit messages.
- **Pushing and Pull Requests**: Familiarize yourself with pushing branches and opening pull requests.
- **Switching Branches**: Use `git checkout` to switch between branches.
- **Remote Branches**: List remote branches with `git branch -r`.
- **Undoing Changes**: Use `git revert <commit-hash>` to undo specific changes.
- **Navigating Directories**: Use commands like `ls` and `cd` to navigate your file system.
- **Tree View**: On Windows, use `tree /F` to see a tree representation of directories and files.

## Development Environment Setup

### Preparation & Expectation:
1. **Download VS Code** from the Microsoft Store.
2. **Get your GitHub Account**.

### Explore:
#### A. Environment Creation and Activation:
- Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv_name
venv_name/Scripts/activate
```
- Know where `.git` is located and where your environment is installed.

#### B. Common Command Line Commands:
- Change directory: `cd <directory>`
- Move up one directory: `cd ..`
- Check status: `git status`
- Add changes to staging: `git add .`
- Commit changes: `git commit -m "feat: add feature"`
- Push changes: `git push`
- Pull changes: `git pull`
- Rebase: `git pull --rebase`
- Create a branch: `git branch branch_name`
- Switch to a branch: `git checkout branch_name`
- Fetch all branches: `git fetch --all`
- Create a pull request on GitHub
- Clone a repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
- Tree view of directories: `tree /F`
- Install Python packages: `pip install <package>`
- Freeze packages: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- Show installed packages: `pip show <package>`

#### C. Common Python Project Structure:
- `main.py`
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `LICENSE`
- Modules
- Importing modules
- `__init__.py`
- `requirements.txt`

#### D. Start a Project on VS Code:
1. Open a folder.
2. Change directory to your project: `cd <project-directory>`.
3. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`.
4. Create and activate the environment.
5. Check status: `git status`.
6. Make changes, save, check status, add changes, commit, and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add features"
git push
```
7. Verify changes on GitHub, and vice versa.

### Extras:
- **Extensions and GUI on VS Code**.
- **Questions**: Think of any questions based on the above content.
- **Pipreqs Command Line**.
- **Forking GitHub Repositories**: Understand local and remote repositories.
- **Ubuntu and WSL**: Explore if needed.
